# Code Editor Web App

This is a web app where you can write and run JavaScript code. It has a code editor and some useful features.

## Features

- **Code Editor**: A special text box for writing code.

- **Copy Code**: A button to quickly copy your code.

- **Save Code**: The "Save" button isn't for saving files, it just tells you that your code is saved.

- **Lock/Unlock Editor**: Use "Lock" to prevent changes or "Unlock" to edit your code.

- **Run Code**: Press "Run" to see the result or any errors from your code.

4. Write JavaScript code in the editor.

5. Click "Run" to see what your code does.
